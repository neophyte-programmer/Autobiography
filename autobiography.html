        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello. My name is Nutifafa. I am a seventeen year old poet, keyboardist and amateur sound engineer. I attended Achimota School and I am hoping to further my education in the university of Ghana as an I.T student. My hobbies include reading, writing poetry, making and listening to music and watching movies.
            I wish to become a cyber security analyst or a musical performer and music teacher.

          I started studying music as part of my course in Achimota in 2017. I started out by learning basic music theory and a year later, I taught myself how to play the piano.
          <br> In Achimota, I was trained by being given the fundamentals to become a vocalist and a composer. I have taken two major examinations based on my performance as a soprano vocalist and a composer of which I came out successful.
          <br> In the early period of the year, 2020, I began to acquaint myself with sound engineering and music production. Though I am still learning new things about producing music, I have produced some which would be placed below for you to comment on. <br>
